    Top level server code.

    ------------------

    Will use a dictionary to store the DNS data.
        - The dictionary will be formatted in the following way:
            - key : hostname (the url)
            - value: tuple -> (ip address, A/NS)
    
    ----------------

    The rs code will be organized several methods and the main section that calls the methods. The methods are:
        - getDNSEntries
        - processDNSQuery (check if hostname exists in the server dictionary)

        Method to set up server and keep it running. Based on project zero code.

        Will receive requests from the client and check the dns dictionary

        exists. If it does then its corresponding details will be returned, if not then
        the error message will be returned.

        For now will bind server to localhost and test on same machine for all scripts.
        Will change this later to include capabilities to run on multiple machines.

        ...

        ***Note !!!!! ***
        Also currently this code is written so that the server closes after one client request is served.
        I do not know yet if this is right or how to do it in another way. We can test and look up how to 
        do it the best way going forward. Sorry for leaving it incomplete.

        ...

        ***Note !***
        The code for ts.py will be very similar to this if not identical.
